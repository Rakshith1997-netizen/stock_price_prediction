# 📈 Stock Price Prediction

Welcome to **Stock Price Prediction** — a project where machine learning meets the chaotic world of stock prices!  
This repository predicts stock prices using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict future stock prices based on historical data
- **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Data Preprocessing & Scaling
  - Sequence Creation
  - LSTM Neural Network
  - RMSE Error Analysis
  - Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Prices

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Collect historical stock price data
2. Scale the data for better learning
3. Create training sequences
4. Train an LSTM model on the sequences
5. Evaluate predictions using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
6. Visualize both predictions and prediction errors

## 📚 Requirements

```bash
pip install torch pandas yfinance numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Incorporate external indicators like volume, RSI, MACD
- Experiment with GRU, Transformer-based models
- Try attention mechanisms on time series data
- Deploy the model with a simple UI (maybe Streamlit?)
